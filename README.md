This package implements a wrapper which allows the user to load the
LaTeX-independent part of LaTeX package `etoolbox` in other formats.

Load the package by `\input etoolbox-generic`.

The wrapper has been tested in plain TeX and ConTeXt on `etoolbox` version
`2020/10/05 v2.5k`.  (The version of the wrapper should match the latest
`etoolbox` version.)
